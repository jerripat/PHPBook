Car Selector Web Pages
======================

PART 1

Write a PHP program for car selector.

The program should consist of an html page with the form and a php handler page which does the processing.


html page
---------

Create an html page called cars.html making sure that it is a valid xhtml page and has a title in the <title> tag.

The form should consist of : 

(1) A set of radio buttons with three options of 'BMW', 'VW' and 'Ford'

(2) A drop down list of available colours.

(3) A text box which can accept the age of the customer.

(4) A check box to identify if the customer wants a new or used car.

All the data should be in the form of an array so, for example the available colours would have an a array of :

$arrColours = {'1' => 'Red', '2' => 'Green', '3' => 'Blue', '4' => 'Plum', '5' => 'Purple', '6' => White, '7' => 'Yellow'};

Writing all the data in as arrays mean that the application could be changed when the data is extracted 
from a database data source.

Create the drop down lists and radio button lists using foreach loops.



php handler page
----------------

Store each of the results into an array of session variables and display the session variables on the 
php handler page.  The session variables will allow you to return to the html page and enter in 
another selection.

Validate the age of the customer as an integer value and that the customers age is at least 17.
